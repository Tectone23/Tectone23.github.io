# How To Add A Project

## What is a Project?

In Tectone Desktop a project is a development intended to be built on top of T-Core Tectone Blockchain. When adding a new project it will be setup with its own sandbox environment isolated from other projects.

When adding a project, choose the name of a project and the folder will be given the same name lowercased and, instead of spaces the words will be hyphenated.

## Adding a Project

At the projects screen you can access the button to add a new project. Click on it and it will navigate you to the screen where you can create a new project.

Give your project a name, select where your project directory should be created. The name of the folder created will be generated from the project name. Finally, agree to the agreement that dependencies will be downloaded from github.

## Projects Listed

The projects are listed in a table with the sandbox status showing whether it is _running_ or it has _exited_, and you can access the project's configuration by clicking on the gears at the start of the row. You will also see the state of the project's development environment running. From here you can start and stop a project's sandbox.

## Project Configuration

From within the Project's configuration you can edit the name of the project. This will not have effect on the project's folder name, but is purely for how your project is listed on the screen where all projects are listed.
