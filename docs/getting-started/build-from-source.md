# Build From Source

Tectone Desktop is built using Go and utilizes the Wails framework for the user interface. To build the application from source for MacOs, Windows, and Linux, you'll need the following:

- **Go**: Download and install Go from the official website (https://go.dev/doc/install) following the instructions for your specific operating system. Ensure you have set up your GOPATH environment variable.

- **Node Package Manager (NPM)**: We recommend using Node Version Manager (nvm) to manage Node.js versions. You can find installation instructions for nvm on this guide (https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/node-version-manager-nvm-install-guide/). Once nvm is installed, use it to install the latest stable version of Node.js. With Node.js installed, NPM will be available.

**Note**: Make sure you have both Go and NPM installed and configured correctly before proceeding.

The source code for Tectone Desktop can be found on the Tectone23 Github repository:
